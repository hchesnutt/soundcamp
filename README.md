Sandcamp was started as clone of Bandcamp. Over the development process it began to take on aesthetics of my own music taste. I also added in some of the functionality of Soundcloud (mainly the persistent media player). It uses Ruby on Rails on the backend, a postgreSQL database, and React.js with Redux on the frontend.
